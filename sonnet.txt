Some years ago, in quiet Berkeley
I found your love, and it could not be beat
Your body felt like it was made for me
Your wit and kindness made your charm complete

But now, as years go by and I look back
I think I underestimated you
Together we've created a whole pack
Now you're the perfect wife, and mother too

The pillar of our family, in our heart
You show your love in many different ways
With reading, snuggling, teaching, making art
You build foundations for our happy days

It's not my love alone you've earned, it's more
The love for you has multiplied by four.
